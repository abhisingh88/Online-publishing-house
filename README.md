# Online Publishing House

Keeping various aspect of a publishing house in the mind i've made this web application for various user in the process like Publisher, Author, Reader etc.
Author will submit the file to Publisher in 2 format 

"Self Publishing" where Author will check and directly publish it on the platform

"Manuscript" where Author will give only the content and Publisher will manage all other thing.

Users have to subscribe to the plans and accoridngly he/she will get access.

Publisher Section to see the files submited by Author and approve accoridngly.
